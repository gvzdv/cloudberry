CALC_PROMPT = '''
This is a question from user.
Create a Python function to answer this request. Do not add any comments. 
Make sure that in the last line of the code you call the function and write the answer in the variable 'result'. Do not use the 'print' function.
'result' should be a string. If you made any calculations in the script, use an f-string to provide a commentary along with the calculation result. 
The script should be in triple backticks and start with word python.
'''

THOUGHT_PROMPT = '''
Answer the question from the user to the best of your ability.
'''

FINAL_PROMPT = '''
Here are the user's question and two approaches to answer it. 
The first one is a result of a Python script.
The second one is an answer suggested without the script.
Compare two options to the best of your ability and write the correct final answer without comments. 
If the question contains a request to count, calculate or compare values, consider the script option correct. Otherwise, use common sense.
